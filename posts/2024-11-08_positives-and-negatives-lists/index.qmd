I thought it would be interesting for me to keep better track of the Pros, Cons and Neutrals that I discover/decide on and to find a way to visualise these nicely. The idea came to me when I was wanting to create a new Quarto blogpost and googled for a quick solution to find [this issue](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3917) where it's noted

> But a current limitation is that all are R focused rather than general quarto CLI tooling.

That gets to the heart of something that could put off some R users migrating from RMarkdown to Quarto... but also that's the whole point of Quarto to be cross-platform.

Right! So what would a Pros / Cons / Neutrals list look like? Well, `{bslib}` has nice cards available. So it could be something like this:

::: {.column-page .grid}

::: {.g-col-4}
```{r}
card(
  full_screen = TRUE,
  card_header(
    emo::ji("white_check_mark"),
    "Quarto installs with few permissions"
  ),
  card_body(
    p("Makes it really easy to use in training.")
  )
)
```

:::

::: {.g-col-4}

```{r}
card(
  card_header(
    emo::ji("neutral_face"),
    "Quarto quick tools are difficult to make as it's a CLI!"
  ),
  card_body(
    p("RMarkdown has lovely features like `blogdown::new_post()` that can't really be added to Quarto as it's a CLI! Usability tools would need to be added to the CLI instead of the wrapping package.")
  ),
  card_footer(
    emo::ji("gear"), "This doesn't need to change",
    p("That's the nature of the beast")
  )
)
```

:::

::: {.g-col-4}
```{r}
card(
  card_header(
    emo::ji("x"),
    "Quarto occassionally summons demons"
  ),
  card_body(
    p("It doesn't, that's a lie.")
  ),
  card_footer(
    emo::ji("gear"), "Needs to change. Raised issue on GitHub."
  )
)
```

## Feature creep

Ever heard of feature creep? She's a beast.

I decided the fastest way to record these would be in a Google Sheet that I can then read easily into a Shiny app. But then I thought - I'd love to [MoSCoW this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method). Which then led to me building up a bunch of data validation rules:

... and gosh, I'd discovered I was procrastinating. I'm really aiming to up my data blogging output and feel part of the tech community again. So, let's settle with something that's workable... an iOS note that I can also modify on my laptop.
