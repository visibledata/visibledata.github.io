```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

Surprisingly often I'm asked to help folks build maps which visualise the journeys between geographic locations, in the bad old days of early 2017 I would have used the `geospheres` package and `sp`. 

That's because the shortest distance between two points on a map is a **great circle**, and `geospheres` is capable of computing such things. Note that it's these great circles that you see on flight information screens, their exact curvature depends on the projection of the map.

However, I'm now an `sf` convert and try to do everything within that package. In my original version of this blogpost I introduced my painfully inefficient way to compute these great circles with `sf` and asked folks in the [R4DS Slack group](https://medium.com/@kierisi/r4ds-the-next-iteration-d51e0a1b0b82) run by [Jesse Maegan](https://www.jessemaegan.com/) if they had any suggested improvements, which I've now baked in below.

Typically my datasets are collections of journeys, here's an example of what the data looks like (these are some of the journeys I took during the 3 years I worked for Wolfram Research):

```{r create-journey-data, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library("tidyverse")
library("sf")
raw_journey_data <- tribble(
  ~start.long, ~start.lat, ~end.long, ~end.lat, ~name,
  -0.118092, 51.509865, -119.698189, 34.420830, "London to Santa Barbara",
  31.496773, 30.026300, 24.753574, 59.436962, "New Cairo to Tallinn",
  126.633333, 45.75, 46.738586, 24.774265, "Harbin to Riyadh"
)
raw_journey_data
```

```{r hidden-dt, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("sf")
library("DT")
raw_journey_data <- tribble(
  ~start.long, ~start.lat, ~end.long, ~end.lat, ~name,
  -0.118092, 51.509865, -119.698189, 34.420830, "London to Santa Barbara",
  31.496773, 30.026300, 24.753574, 59.436962, "New Cairo to Tallinn",
  126.633333, 45.75, 46.738586, 24.774265, "Harbin to Riyadh"
)
dt_journeys <- datatable(
  raw_journey_data,
  rownames = FALSE,
  options = list(
    dom = "t",
    pageLength = 3
  )
)
widgetframe::frameWidget(dt_journeys, height = "100%")
```

I've split this post into two sections below:

- journeys_to_sf: A function for reliably converting journey data to an `sf` object that can be plotted with `leaflet` and `ggplot2`
- Creating `sf` features from `data.frames`

# journeys_to_sf

Here's my function for converting a `data.frame` containing journeys to a usable `"sf" "data.frame"` through the use of [tidyeval](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html):

```{r journeys-to-sf}
journeys_to_sf <- function(journeys_data,
                           start_long = start.long,
                           start_lat = start.lat,
                           end_long = end.long,
                           end_lat = end.lat) {
  quo_start_long <- enquo(start_long)
  quo_start_lat <- enquo(start_lat)
  quo_end_long <- enquo(end_long)
  quo_end_lat <- enquo(end_lat)

  journeys_data %>%
    select(
      !! quo_start_long,
      !! quo_start_lat,
      !! quo_end_long,
      !! quo_end_lat
    ) %>%
    transpose() %>%
    map(~ matrix(flatten_dbl(.), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)) %>%
    map(st_linestring) %>%
    st_sfc(crs = 4326) %>%
    st_sf(geometry = .) %>%
    bind_cols(journeys_data) %>%
    select(everything(), geometry)
}
```

This can very easily be inserted into a pipe chain for visualising with `leaflet`:

```{r function-example}
library("leaflet")
raw_journey_data %>%
  journeys_to_sf() %>%
  st_segmentize(units::set_units(100, km)) %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolylines() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    lng = ~start.long,
    lat = ~start.lat,
    color = "green",
    opacity = 1,
    radius = 2
  ) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    lng = ~end.long,
    lat = ~end.lat,
    color = "red",
    opacity = 1,
    radius = 2
  ) %>%
  addLegend(
    colors = c(
      "green",
      "red"
    ),
    labels = c(
      "Journey start",
      "Journey end"
    )
  )
```

A quick note to say, `leaflet` is an awesome `htmlwidget` for building interactive maps. If you've never heard of `htmlwidgets` before, check out my blogpost; [where's the love for htmlwidgets?](http://www.visibledata.co.uk/blog/2018/02/07/2018-02-07_where-s-the-love-for-htmlwidgets/)

# Creating `sf` features from `data.frame`

The `sf` library allows R folks to work with GIS data using the very widely used [Simple Features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features) standard for working with 2D geometries. All `sf` objects are constructed from a combination of 17 unique "simple features", which are usefully [summarised here](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html#simple-feature-geometry-types).

Originally my blogpost used a quite inefficient method for converting `data.frame` to `sf`. Thankfully I'm a member of the excellent [R4DS Slack group](https://www.jessemaegan.com/post/r4ds-the-next-iteration/) and I got great advice from [Jesse Sadler](https://twitter.com/vivalosburros) and [Kent Johnson](http://kentsjohnson.com/). Here's my old horrible method of doing things:

```{r old-method}
start_locs <- raw_journey_data %>%
  select(
    start.long,
    start.lat
  ) %>%
  setNames(c("long", "lat")) %>%
  mutate(journey_id = row_number())

end_locs <- raw_journey_data %>%
  select(
    end.long,
    end.lat
  ) %>%
  setNames(c("long", "lat")) %>%
  mutate(journey_id = row_number())

journey_data_linestrings <- start_locs %>%
  bind_rows(end_locs) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("long", "lat")) %>%
  group_by(journey_id) %>%
  arrange(journey_id) %>%
  summarise() %>%
  st_cast("LINESTRING")

journey_data_linestrings <- st_set_crs(journey_data_linestrings, st_crs(4326))

journey_data <- raw_journey_data
st_geometry(journey_data) <- st_geometry(journey_data_linestrings)
journey_data
```

Let's go through the stages required and re-write my method to be more `purrr` dependent:

1. Create a list of `LINESTRING`s
1. Combine the list `LINESTRING`s into a collection of `sf` features
1. Join this collection of `sf` features with the original dataset

## LINESTRINGs

We need `LINESTRING`s for our great circles as these represent a *"sequence of points connected by straight, non-self intersecting line pieces; one-dimensional geometry"*. As with all simple features, `LINESTRING`s are constructed from matrices:

```{r linestring-example, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, results='hide'}
st_linestring(matrix(1:6, 3))
```

Let's extract the start and end coordinates from our `raw_journeys_data` and convert them to a `list` with `purrr::transpose`:

```{r transpose-to-list}
raw_journey_data %>% 
  select(-name) %>% 
  transpose()
```

These lists can easily be converted to matrices using `map`:

```{r list-to-matrices}
raw_journey_data %>% 
  select(-name) %>% 
  transpose() %>% 
  map(~ matrix(flatten_dbl(.), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)) 
```

... and finally we can convert these to 

```{r matrices, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, results='hide'}
list_of_linestrings <- raw_journey_data %>%
  select(-name) %>%
  transpose() %>%
  map(~ matrix(flatten_dbl(.), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)) %>%
  map(st_linestring)
list_of_linestrings
```

## Collecting features

Eventually we will create an `"sf" "data.frame"` which contains our `LINESTRING`s in the `geometry` column. We create a set of features for this column from our list of `LINESTRING`s with the `st_sfc` function. Note that we need to specify a coordinate system, the most obvious choice is the WGS84 coordinate reference system, that's why we specify `crs = 4326`:

```{r geometry-set}
list_of_linestrings %>%
  st_sfc(crs = 4326)
```

Now we have this set of features we create a collection of them in a `"sf" "data.frame"` with `st_sf`:

```{r geometry-collection}
collection_sf <- list_of_linestrings %>%
  st_sfc(crs = 4326) %>%
  st_sf(geometry = .)
collection_sf
```

## Joining feature collections with data

As `sf` collections store all of the GIS data in a column it's very easy to combine this object with our original data - we use `dplyr::bind_columns`

```{r bind-cols}
collection_sf %>%
  bind_cols(raw_journey_data)
```

We can now perform calculations on our dataset, for instance compute great circles with a resolution of 100km:

```{r basic-map}
collection_sf %>%
  bind_cols(raw_journey_data) %>%
  st_segmentize(units::set_units(100, km)) %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolylines(label = ~name)
```

Sadly, there's no good solution for adding arrow heads to these great circles - they would be heavily distorted by the map projection and would look ugly. An alternative solution to showing where journeys start and end is to use different coloured circle markers:

```{r labelled-leaflet-map}
collection_sf %>%
  bind_cols(raw_journey_data) %>%
  st_segmentize(units::set_units(100, km)) %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolylines() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    lng = ~start.long,
    lat = ~start.lat,
    color = "green",
    opacity = 1,
    radius = 2
  ) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    lng = ~end.long,
    lat = ~end.lat,
    color = "red",
    opacity = 1,
    radius = 2
  ) %>%
  addLegend(
    colors = c(
      "green",
      "red"
    ),
    labels = c(
      "Journey start",
      "Journey end"
    )
  )
```
