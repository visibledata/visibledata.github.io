Over the course of the 12 weeks students build up a solid understanding of R and how to use RMarkdown to create rich and easy to read reports.\nThe course is $999 or $399 for those in countries with lower GDPs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course was designed and is co-taught by David Keyes from the wonderful R for the Rest of Us consultancy.
