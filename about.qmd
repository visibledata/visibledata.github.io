Visible Data is my data science consultancy. Who am I? I'm Charlotte Hadley but usually go by Charlie and use the handle [@charliejhadley](https://twitter.com/charliejhadley) almost universally.

I'm an R instructor and data science consultant. This is website serves as a portfolio of my courses, charts and other things that don't have a good home elsewhere. I'm also an Open Data and Reproducible Research evangelist.

I also happen to be trans üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è. All tech is political and our common future requires [intersectionality](https://time.com/5560575/intersectionality-theory/).

## Can I make a website like this?

Yup! I'm indebted to [Drew Dimmery](https://ddimmery.com/) who makes the source of his Quarto website available here - [https://github.com/ddimmery/quarto-website](https://github.com/ddimmery/quarto-website)
