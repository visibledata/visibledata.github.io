We have a wide variety of on-demand training courses available from several online learning providers and also provide bespoke training courses both in-person and online.

In addition we deliver [regular public courses through JB International and the Royal Statistical Society](#public-courses). I'm also a visiting lecturer at Birmingham City University.

I'm particularly proud of my work as a co-instructor with David Keyes on the excellent [R in 3 Months](https://rfortherestofus.com/3months/) course that runs twice a year in the Spring and Fall.

The course includes weekly assignments where students **use their own datasets** and I record personalised feedback videos for each student. Over the course of the 12 weeks students build up a solid understanding of R and how to use RMarkdown to create rich and easy to read reports.

The course is $999 or $399 for those in countries with lower GDPs.

## On-demand Training

#### LinkedIn Learning

I've been recording training courses for LinkedIn Learning since 2016. Access to these courses is available through a LinkedIn Premium subscription or can be purchased a la carte. Many Universities provide students and staff with free access to LinkedIn Learning - check with your IT department.

#### Mapping with R ($99)

<div class="card-body">

::: {.row}
<a href="https://rfortherestofus.com/courses/mapping/" arget="_blank" class="stretched-link"></a>

:::: {.col-md-9}

I've designed this course specifically for folks who've never built a map or worked with GIS datasets before. The course introduces you to the excellent {sf} package and how to use it alongside the tidyverse for wrangling and exploring spatial data.

You'll then learn how to create static maps with {ggplot2} and interactive maps with {leaflet}. I'll also ensure you go away with sufficiency knowledge to work with projections, CRS and where to obtain shapefiles.

This course is available through the excellent **R for the Rest of Us** course catalogue.

## Public courses

:::: {.columns}

- I partner with **JB International** to deliver [monthly scheduled public R courses](https://jbinternational.co.uk/courses/r). <br>
JB International have 20+ years experience in hosting and organising corporate training courses - but we also often see academics in these public courses too. Public courses are an affordable choice and an excellent opportunity to learn alongside other folks. If you'd prefer a bespoke course, [please see below](#custom-training-courses).

- I also deliver 3 courses a year through the [Royal Statistical Society](https://rss.org.uk/training-events/training/public-courses/). <br>
These courses are attended equally by both academics and folks from industry. This happens to be the most cost effective way to attend our courses, for non-RSS members attendance is Â£693.60 + VAT.

## Custom training courses

:::: {.columns}

Our training courses focus on using the R language for data science, reporting or data visualisation. Our courses are delivered using RMardown lecture slides for foundational material and use live coding exercises to replicate the real-world experience of using R. 

We encourage learners to tell us:

> "we need that chart/dashboard to do X"
>
> or
>
> "that's not good enough for our needs - we need Y"

I'd recommend considering [booking a bespoke course through our partner JB International](https://jbinternational.co.uk/page/44/contact-page). They've been working with both small and (very) large corporates since 1995 and are better suited to processing payments and booking requests than my small consultancy. I genuinely enjoy working with these folks - they're very fair to me and to their customers.

If you would prefer to get in touch directly with me, then please email me at **charlie@visibledata.co.uk**.
