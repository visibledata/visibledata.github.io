<h3 id="who-is-this-course-for">Who is this course for?</h3>
<p>This course is designed for those who want to create interactive data visualisations with R, including; charts, maps, choropleth, networks, graph and sankey diagrams. In this course you will learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reproducibly read data into R using the tidyverse</li>
<li>Wrangle messy data from Excel files into tidy, analysable data with the tidyverse</li>
<li>Design interactive dataviz to explore and understand your data</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-much-r-do-i-need-to-know">How much R do I need to know?</h3>
<p>This course is designed for both new and existing users of R. All the pre-requisite skills for creating the data visualisations will be taught in the two days. We‚Äôve split tickets into new and existing users to save you time - no pre-course survey!</p>
<p>Your trainer (Martin John Hadley) has run this course for 3 years to over 500 students. Martin is confident that you won‚Äôt be left behind if your new and will have plenty to learn if you‚Äôre unfamiliar with the tidyverse and htmlwidgets.</p>
<h3 id="byod-bring-your-own-device">BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)</h3>
<p>This course is BYOD. You must bring your own machine. This is because we want you to learn how to do things on your machine.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre always happy when folks have a variety of Operating Systems (Windows, macOS and Linux) as it allows us to demonstrate just how reproducible and portable R code can be. We‚Äôll send you download instructions 3 days before the training event.</p>
<h3 id="schedule">Schedule</h3>

<p>Martin John Hadley. Hello! You can find me on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/martinjhnhadley">@martinjhnhadley</a>) and on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinjohnhadley/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm an RSE at University of Oxford where I teach R on a number of Masters programmes and at divisional level to PhD researchers, I also founded the <a href="http://idn.it.ox.ac.uk/">Interactive Data Network</a> which uses Shiny to make research data more open and accessible.</p>
<p>For the past 4 years* I‚Äôve been delivering in-person commercial training in R, data visualisation and Shiny across the UK. You can also find my on-demand courses on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/martin-john-hadley?u=2125562">LinkedIn Learning &amp; Lynda.com</a>.</p>
<p>*prior to this I worked for 3 years as a consultant for Wolfram Research, where I used and taught Mathematica. But these days I‚Äôve almost completely replaced Mathematica with R in my workflows.</p>

<h3>
Why attend a public course at our offices?
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Public courses are great learning environments.</strong>
<br>
We really enjoy the diversity of experience and industries that public courses bring together, and our delegates have only ever been positive about..
</li>
<li>
<strong>We‚Äôre located in Bristol City Centre.</strong>
<br>
Bristol has great transport links, it‚Äôs also a beautiful and vibrant city to explore at the end of the training day.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Accessibility matters to us.</strong>
<br>
Our training facilities have step-free access and we‚Äôre happy to work with you and make reasonable adjustments. Read about our building‚Äôs accessibility <a href="#accessibility">below</a>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>We use a dedicated, comfortable training room.</strong>
<br>
We‚Äôve set our max number at 15 to assure comfort, you will not be packed in line sardines.
</li>
<li>
<strong>All our training courses are BYOD (Bring Your Own Device).</strong>
<br>
You‚Äôll learn how to do stuff with <strong>your</strong> (<i>work</i>) machine.
</li>
<li>
<strong>We‚Äôve got extension cables for your laptops.</strong>
<br>
You do need to bring your own chargers.
</li>
<li>
<strong>There‚Äôs coffee. And tea. And Wi-fi.</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>We provide lunch from Pret-A-Manger!</strong>
<br>
Before the training day we‚Äôll agree what you‚Äôd like from the <a href='http://pret-files.azureedge.net/pretamanger-uk/Pret_Delivers/Delivery_Lunch_Menu.pdf' target='_blank'>lunch platter menu.</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
What are the benefits of off-site training?
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
If your team is distributed across multiple sites it can be really difficult to decide where to hold training on company sites.
<br>
<strong>Dedicated off-site training sites are neutral territory (and Visible Data has <i>lots</i> of hotels nearby üëã)</strong>
</li>
<li>
Re-purposing a conference room at your office for multiple day training courses is often difficult, there‚Äôs a temptation to break the training up over multiple weeks or over lunch.
<br>
<strong>Using a dedicated training space means you can easily book dedicated multi-day courses.</strong>
</li>
<li>
Using a re-purposed conference room in your building is not going to put your team in the mindset to learn, folks may well be distracted thinking about what they‚Äôre usually in the room for.
<br>
<strong>Off-site training helps put your team in the mindset to learn.</strong>
</li>
<li>
Training on-site is often disrupted by colleagues being able to physically barge into rooms and ‚Äújust check one thing.‚Äù
<br>
<strong>Distractions are massively reduced when using a dedicated off-site training space.</strong>
</li>
