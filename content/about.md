Visible Data is a consultancy and technical training company focusing on data science, data visualisation and reproducibility. Visible Data is also a blog where our team share stories about their work and datasets that interest them. If you'd like to get in touch the best way to do that is by email: contact@visibledata.co.uk.

If physical location is important to you, we split our time between Oxford and Bristol in the UK. However, we're very happy to travel to your offices in the UK and Europe and work with you on your turf.

<!-- **Visible Data** is all about making data more accessible and reproducibly available, so as to bridge what is often called the "data gap". Data visualisation is only a small part of that, but it's the shiniest part. This site makes use of [reproducibility ratings](/reproducibility-ratings) at the top of all the blogposts to help readers identify and find the author, data and code behind the posts. -->
