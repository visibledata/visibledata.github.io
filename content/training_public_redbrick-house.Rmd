R is a tremendously popular and powerful scripting language used by millions of analysts and data scientists around the world, and the recently developed tidyverse provides incredible tools for quickly wrangling, cleaning, understanding and visualising data.

However, many folks feel a little lost in the sea of packages and %>% that they see in in other's code and documentation.

Visible Data specialises in providing training courses that help folks find their feet and gain confidence with a technology. We've been running commercial and academic training courses for over 6 years and know how to get a diverse group of users from okay to confident.

This training course covers the following topics:

- Reproducibly using the tidyverse to import .csv and Excel files into R
- Programmatically cleaning and wrangling data with dplyr, tidyr and more tidyverse packages
- Exploratory data analysis using ggplot2
- Publish publication quality static charts and maps with ggplot2
- Create rich interactive HTML reports with RMarkdown
- Design responsive mobile-ready interactive visualisations using the following htmlwidgets packages: leaflet (choropleth), plotly (scatter plots), highcharter (bar charts), visNetwork (network graph)

<h3>Why attend a public course at our offices?</h3>

<ul>
<li>
**Public courses are great learning environments.** 
<br>
We really enjoy the diversity of experience and industries that public courses bring together, and our delegates have only ever been positive about..</li>
<li>
**We're located in Bristol City Centre.** 
<br>
Bristol has great transport links, it's also a beautiful and vibrant city to explore at the end of the training day.</li>
<li>
**Accessibility matters to us.**
<br>
Our training facilities have step-free access and we're happy to work with you and make reasonable adjustments. Read about our building's accessibility [below](#accessibility).</li>
<li>
**We use a dedicated, comfortable training room.**
<br>
We've set our max number at 15 to assure comfort, you will not be packed in line sardines.</li>
<li>
**All our training courses are BYOD (Bring Your Own Device).**
<br>
You'll learn how to do stuff with <strong>your</strong> (<i>work</i>) machine.</li>
<li>
**We've got extension cables for your laptops.**
<br>
You do need to bring your own chargers.</li>
<li>**There's coffee. And tea. And Wi-fi.**</li>
<li>**We provide lunch from Pret-A-Manger!**
<br>
Before the training day we'll agree what you'd like from the <a href='http://pret-files.azureedge.net/pretamanger-uk/Pret_Delivers/Delivery_Lunch_Menu.pdf' target='_blank'>lunch platter menu.</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>What are the benefits of off-site training?</h3>

<ul>

<li>If your team is distributed across multiple sites it can be really difficult to decide where to hold training on company sites. 
<br>
<strong>Dedicated off-site training sites are neutral territory (and Visible Data has <i>lots</i> of hotels nearby `r emo::ji("wave")`)</strong></li>


<li>Re-purposing a conference room at your office for multiple day training courses is often difficult, there's a temptation to break the training up over multiple weeks or over lunch.
<br>
<strong>Using a dedicated training space means you can easily book dedicated multi-day courses.</strong></li>

<li>Using a re-purposed conference room in your building is not going to put your team in the mindset to learn, folks may well be distracted thinking about what they're usually in the room for.
<br>
<strong>Off-site training helps put your team in the mindset to learn.</strong></li>

<li>Training on-site is often disrupted by colleagues being able to physically barge into rooms and "just check one thing."
<br>
<strong>Distractions are massively reduced when using a dedicated off-site training space.</strong></li>

</ul>
