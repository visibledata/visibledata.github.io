Visible Data is all 


It's extremely important to me to keep things reproducible and woke, here are some promises I commit to:

- Only using public datasets for which a DOI is available. Proprietary munging behind a paywall is acceptable

- Never use gender as a binary variable example (https://twitter.com/polesasunder/status/971622753261572096).

- Spell check

- styler

- lintr

- Refuse to work outside of a file synchronisation system

# Appearance

- Responsive iframes!!! https://www.cultureofinsight.com/blog/2018/03/15/2018-03-15-responsive-iframes-for-shiny-apps/

# Work practices

- Never print if you can.

# Nitpicking

- Never provide vectors if function support NSE 

```{r}
# highchart(type="stock") %>%
#   hc_add_series(data = ibc[1:170,], type="area", hcaes(x = month[1:170], y=deaths[1:170]), name="Total Deaths")
```

- Always use library not require (https://yihui.name/en/2014/07/library-vs-require/)

- Always use "" in library calls to encourage folks not to forget them in install.packages

- Always use `library("tidyverse")` to ensure packages are loaded in correct order

- Always use `library()` at the top of a script file,
