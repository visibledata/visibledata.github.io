```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

After a long time coming, I've finally got round to picking a workable solution for creating my data blog "Visible Data". This is a short overview of how I picked my tools and my intentions for the website.

I had three core requirements which are covered in detail below, and reproducible steps are [provided at the bottom](#replicate-this-blog)

- I could write the blog in RMarkdown
- I could easily include `htmlwidgets` in blogposts (and elsewhere)
- I could use Bootstrap grids wherever I fancied (I'm obsessed with responsive grids)

I'm going to use this blog for the following:

- Document me learning more R and datascience subjects
- Exploring interesting datasets
- Covering topics in reproducabiity and open science

## RMarkdown

Previously I made use of Dean Attali's awesome [Beautiful Jekyll](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) theme for creating a static website website hosted on GitHub Pages. I'd thoroughly recommend this for creating a very quick website where you **don't** need RMarkdown because GitHub's Jekyll builder doesn't support it at all. 

There are a few websites I contribute to that still use Beautiful Jekyll, including the excellent [Reproducible Research Oxford Project](rroxford.github.io) which runs [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) training courses to encourage reproducible research methodologies.

The simplest solution for creating a blog which allows us to write content in RMarkdown is the excellent `blogdown` package, which is thoroughly introduced in Yihui Xie et al's freely available book [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).

## htmlwidgets

<div class="row">

<div class="col-md-6">

If you've never heard of them, `htmlwidgets` are an amazing part of the work that RStudio have undertaken to make R a beautiful tool for doing data science and communicating things about your data.

`htmlwidgets` is a tool for R developers that allows them to easily build R wrappers for JavaScript libraries, which means useRs can build interactive visualisations like the interactive choropleth embedded here using `leaflet`.

Fantastically, `htmlwidgets` are supported natively by `blogdown`.

</div>

<div class="col-md-6">
<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("leaflet")
library("sf")
library("gapminder")

geojson_worldmap <- st_read("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johan/world.geo.json/master/countries.geo.json",
                            quiet = TRUE)
geojson_worldmap <- invisible(geojson_worldmap %>%
  left_join(gapminder %>%
               filter(year == max(year)) , by = c("name" = "country")) %>%
  filter(name != "Antarctica"))
palette_pop <- colorNumeric("YlOrBr" , geojson_worldmap$pop, na.color = "#c0c1c4")
geojson_worldmap %>%
  leaflet(width = "350px",
          height = "200px") %>%
  addPolygons(fillColor = ~palette_pop(pop),
              fillOpacity = 0.8,
              color = "#000",
              weight = 1,
              label = ~name,
              popup = ~paste(name, "had a population of", formatC(pop, big.mark = ","), "in", max(gapminder$year), "<br>", "According to <a href='http://Gapminder.org' target='_blank'>Gapminder.org</a>")) %>%
  addLegend(title = "Hello World",
            colors = NULL,
            labels = NULL)
```
</center>
</div>

However, there's not actually that much love for `htmlwidgets` or promotion of them!. For example, if you search through <a href='https://www.twitter.com/hadleywickham'>@hadleywickham</a>'s tweets from January 2018 to the dawn of Twitter, `htmlwidgets` were only mentioned **three** times! I've blogged about [where's the love for htmlwidgets](http://www.visibledata.co.uk/blog/2018/01/30/2018-01-30-where-s-the-love-for-htmlwidgets/) and produced a **5h+ training course** on [building interactive dataviz with htlmlwidgets for Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/R-tutorials/R-Interactive-Visualizations-htmlwidgets/586671-2.html)

## Bootstrap grids

Boostrap is a framework for building responsive websites - these are websites that *reflow* content as the browser window changes. Bootstrap is very popular and used all over the web, it's also [how `shiny` apps are laid out](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/css.html).

The Hugo theme I used for this `blogdown` website uses Bootstrap which means (for instance) the navigation menu gets collapsed in narrow browser windows. But I can also use elements of Bootstrap wherever I want in blogposts/pages of the site by writing `HTML` in my `.Rmd` files, for instance in the section about htmlwidgets above you'd have seen the choropleth either to the right or below of the first three paragraphs dependent on your browser window size. 

The thing about `RMarkdown` is that it **really** wants content to be rendered according to the rules of `RMarkdown`, which can be a problem with lots of nested HTML. Thankfully, there's a little know feature introduced in [`RMarkdown` v2](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_migrating_from_v1.html) that allows us to turn off markdown processing[^1]:

<pre>
    &lt;!--html_preserve--&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;This will render as HTML not preformatted text&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;!--/html_preserve--&gt;
</pre>

I get carried away with laying things out though, but it's really fun playing with CSS!

## Replicate this site {#replicate-this-blog}

This website uses the wonderful [Hugo Universal Theme](https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme) and was built using the following steps (a slightly tailored version of the workflow in Yihui's book, [**do read the book**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/))

1. Create a new RStudio Project (if you're not using RStudio projects, [you really should be](https://www.lynda.com/R-tutorials/Why-should-you-use-projects-RStudio/586672/648981-4.html))
1. Initialise a git repo with `usethis::usethis::use_git()`
1. Run `blogdown::new_site(theme = 'devcows/hugo-universal-theme')`
1. In the `config.toml` file make the following changes:
    + `baseurl = "/"`
    + `relativeurls = true`
    + Comment out the Google Maps API token
    + Change the navigation tree as you see fit, you can duplicate mine [here](https://github.com/visibledata/visibledata.github.io/blob/master/config.toml) 
1. Add `public/` to your `.gitignore` file
1. Push your changes to GitHub (there's lots of advice on alternatives in [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/deployment.html))
1. Sign up for a Netlify account and link your GitHub repo to Netlify, with these settings on this page [https://app.netlify.com/sites/visibledata/settings/deploys](https://app.netlify.com/sites/visibledata/settings/deploys:
    + `Build commad: hugo`
    + `Publish directory: public`
    + The blogdown book says to use version 0.2 but don't! Instead go to the Hugo news page [https://gohugo.io/news/](https://gohugo.io/news/) and find the most recent version number and add `HUGO_VERSION: X.X` to the "Build environment variables" section
1. Your site should now build :)
