My team at University of Oxford provide research data management and reproducible research advice to researchers across the whole of the University. A fairly common point of contention is where should we meet, and where is the centre of the University?

We broadly agreed that the centre of the University should be calculated as the (weighted) centre of mass of specific buildings or campuses within the University. Two of our favourite options were:

- Centre of mass of all colleges
- Centre of mass of the University divisions

In this blogpost I go through all the steps of scraping and combining data from the OxPoints service and Wikipedia to create the chart below:

<ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">
  <li role="presentation" class="active">
    <a role="tab" data-toggle="tab" href="#including-plots" aria-controls="including-plots">Centres through time</a>

There are many steps to this process. I've decided to experiment with an accordion layout for this post, so it's not immediately obvious how long the post is!

### How to follow along

If you want to follow along, please follow these steps first:

1. Create a new RStudio project

2. Create a data directory by running `dir.create("data")`

3. Create a script file in the `data` directory called `obtain-oxpoints-data.R`, we'll use this to scrape data from Oxpoint.

<div class="panel-body">

OxPoints is a tool for [accessing geographic information about University of Oxford](https://help.it.ox.ac.uk/oxpoints/index) and was mostly put together by my friend and ex-colleague [Alex Dutton](https://twitter.com/alexsdutton). Now I've highlighted Alex is a friend, I can be slightly more candid in scraping data from the service...

We're going to extract the shapefiles for all colleges in the university and store the data in ESRI shapefiles.

We need to load the following libraries at the top of our `data-raw/obtain-oxpoints-data.R` script:

```{r blog-libraries-to-obtain-data, eval=FALSE}
library("jsonlite")
library("tidyverse")
library("sf")
library("here")
library("rvest")
library("mapview")
```

There's not a fantastically well documented way to obtain college data from the API. After jigging about with the search fields the query below returns everything we need, and then we then subset the data (after much trial and error):

```{r blog-raw-colleges-json, eval = FALSE, tidy = 'styler'}
raw_json_oxpoints_colleges <- read_json("https://maps.ox.ac.uk/api/places/search?type=%2Funiversity%2Fcollege&inoxford=true&-type_exact=%5C%2Funiversity%5C%2Fsub-library&-type_exact=%5C%2Funiversity%5C%2Froom&count=50&facet=type_exact")

oxpoints_colleges <- raw_json_oxpoints_colleges$`_embedded`$pois
```

The `oxpoints_colleges` object contains data for all 38 colleges (at the time of writing). We're going to iteratively extract the college data through this `get_college_data()` function.

```{r blog-get-college-data-function, eval = FALSE, tidy = 'styler'}
get_college_data <- function(oxpoints_data,
                             college_index){
  
  college_properties <- names(oxpoints_data[[college_index]])
  
  extracted_properties <-
    college_properties[college_properties %in% c(
      "id",
      "lat",
      "lon",
      "name",
      "name_sort",
      "shape",
      "social_facebook",
      "website")]
  
  oxpoints_data[[college_index]] %>%
    .[extracted_properties] %>%
    as_tibble() %>%
    mutate_if(is.list, funs(as.character(.))) %>%
    mutate_all(funs(parse_guess(.)))
  
}

```

Let's extract the first college to create an object we can iteratively fill:

```{r blog-setup-college-data-object, eval=FALSE}
college_oxpoints_data <- oxpoints_colleges %>%
  get_college_data(1)
```

Now we can use `pwalk` to iterate over all other colleges:

```{r blog-populate-college-data, eval=FALSE}
tibble(x = 2:38) %>%
  pwalk(function(x){college_oxpoints_data <<- college_oxpoints_data %>%
    bind_rows(get_college_data(oxpoints_colleges, x))})
```

Our `college_oxpoints_data` object contains the geometry of each college in the `shape` column and two columns `lat` and `long` of unknown provenance - let's drop those as well as `name_sort` and `id`.

```{r blog-show-college-data, eval=FALSE}
college_oxpoints_data <- college_oxpoints_data %>%
  select(-lat, -lon, -id, -name_sort)
```

```{r internal-print-ill-formed-gis-data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
college_oxpoints_data <- read_csv(here("static", "data", "oxford-centres_ill-formed-gis-data.csv"))
head(college_oxpoints_data)
```

Let's augment this data with whatever we can easily collect from the Wikipedia page on the Oxford Colleges.

<div id="wiki-table" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

The [Colleges of the University of Oxford Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleges_of_the_University_of_Oxford) provides a useful summary of the colleges, including; year of foundation, financial assets and number of students. We've already loaded the `rvest` package at the top of our script file, which is the go-to tool for web scraping with R. First, let's import the web page using `read_html`. 

```{r blog-read-wikipage}
colleges_of_oxford <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleges_of_the_University_of_Oxford")
```

We want to extract the tables from the web page, which we achieve using `html_nodes()`. Specifically, we only care about the 3rd table.

```{r 2018-12-29-oxford-centres-1}
colleges_of_oxford <- colleges_of_oxford %>%
  html_nodes("table")
colleges_of_oxford <- colleges_of_oxford[[3]]
```

The `rvest` package does contain a useful function (`html_table()`) for parsing well-formed tables into tibbles. Unfortunately, our table is not very well formed at all. The first row spans the whole table and contains a glossary for abbreviations in the table, please don't format your own tables like this. I've decided to get around this by extracting all rows from the table, which have the html tag `<tr>` and extract the contents of these nodes into character vectors using `html_text()`.

```{r 2018-12-29-oxford-centres-2}
colleges_of_oxford <- colleges_of_oxford %>%
  html_nodes("tbody") %>%
  html_nodes("tr") %>%
  html_text()
```

We'll throw away the top row by asking for parts `2:length(.)` and also clean up and nasty trailing/leading white space with `str_trim()`.

```{r 2018-12-29-oxford-centres-3}
colleges_of_oxford <- colleges_of_oxford %>%
  .[2:length(.)] %>%
  str_trim() 
```

Now we can convert our vector of characters into a `tibble`! In the original table, the [newline character `\n`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline) separates pieces of data in each row. So we can use `str_replace_all` to replace any sequence of repeating `\n` with a `;` and then parse this as a table with `read_delim()`. Let's also tidy up the column names before we forget.

```{r 2018-12-29-oxford-centres-4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
colleges_of_oxford <- colleges_of_oxford %>%
  str_replace_all("\n{1,}", ";") %>%
  read_delim(delim = ";")
colnames(colleges_of_oxford) <- c("name", "foundation.year", "sister.college", "total.assets", "financial.endowment", "undergraduates", "post.graduates", "visiting.students", "male.students", "female.students", "total.students", "assets.per.student")
```

There are several messy columns that we need to convert into numeric data:

```{r 2018-12-29-oxford-centres-5}
colleges_of_oxford %>%
  slice(8:9) %>%
  select(name, foundation.year, total.assets, financial.endowment)
```

Turns out `readr::parse_number()` is clever enough to fix our column. It's convenient to use `mutate_at` to modify many columns at once, having previously re-arranged columns so all the targets are together:

```{r 2018-12-29-oxford-centres-6}
colleges_of_oxford <- colleges_of_oxford %>%
  select(name, sister.college, everything()) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(foundation.year:undergraduates), funs(
    if (class(.) == "numeric") {
      .
    } else {
      parse_number(.)
    }
  ))
```

We've now got all of the information I wanted about the colleges, so let's combine the tables with `left_join()`. But this isn't a well formatted dataset for GIS analysis/visualisation. For that we need to use the `sf` package.

```{r 2018-12-29-oxford-centres-7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
college_data <- college_oxpoints_data %>%
  left_join(colleges_of_oxford)
```

Creating an `sf` object

<div class="panel-body">

`sf tibbles` are the augmented tibbles of the excellent `sf` package. They contain both the necessary geometric data for computing & visualising GIS features, and additional non-geometric data about each feature (i.e. the founding year of the college).

Let's remove the `shape` column from `college_data` to provide us with the purely non-geometric data columns, and we'll append the

Let's extract all the non-geometric data columns from `college_data` with `select()` and create a new tibble `college_nongeometric_data` that we'll append the geometric data to below.

```{r blog-new-sf-object}
college_nongeometric_data <- college_data %>%
  select(-shape)
```

In my opinion, this is the one and only fiddly part of using `sf`. We need to create an `sfc` object, which is achieved with the `st_as_sfc()` function. However, this function needs a *vector* of the features and not a `tibble`; which is why in the code below we use `.[[1]]`. If you're unfamiliar with this trick, please refer to [Hadley Wickham's pepper shaker tutorial](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/643381054758363136).

```{r blog-create-college-geometries, eval = TRUE}
college_features <- college_data %>%
  select(shape) %>%
  .[[1]]
college_geometries <- st_as_sfc(college_features)
```

We can now augment `college_nongeometric_data` with this `sfc` object via the `st_geometry()` function. Finally, we'll create a copy of this with a sensible name: `college_shapes` 

```{r blog-append-geometry-data, eval=TRUE}
st_geometry(college_nongeometric_data) <- college_geometries
college_shapes <- college_nongeometric_data
```

Our `sf tibble` currently suffers from two issues:

- There's no projection. We'll assign the standard WGS84 projection with `st_set_crs`.
- The geometry objects are currently `POLYGON Z` and `MULTIPOLYGON Z` with zero values for `z`. As all values are zero, they're pointless and can be removed with `st_zm`.

```{r blog-crs-and-zm, eval = TRUE}
college_shapes <- college_shapes %>%
  st_set_crs(4326) %>%
  st_zm()
```

Understanding our shapefiles with `mapview`

<div id="visualise-with-leaflet" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Before continuing forwards, we should ensure our shapefiles are what we assume they are: the grounds of each college in the University of Oxford. The `mapview` package is incredibly useful for exploring and understanding `sf tibbles`. If you've been following along precisely, the script file your in already loads `mpaview`!

```{r first-look-mapview}
mp_colleges <- college_shapes %>%
  mapview()
mp_colleges
```

How does this help us? Well, we can see that the colleges of the University are mostly clustered together around the city centre and there are some outliers like Wolfson College. If you clicked around a little, you'd also notice that some colleges have multiple sites (they're MULTIPOLYGONS in the data).

```{r 2018-12-29-oxford-centres-8}
college_shapes %>%
  slice(which(st_geometry_type(college_shapes) == "MULTIPOLYGON")) %>%
  mapview(zcol = "name", alpha.regions = 1)
```

Fortunately, for all five of these colleges the largest polygon is the actual college and all other polygons can be considered superfluous to the calculation of where the centre of Oxford is. So how do we go about extracting the largest polygon from MULTIPOLYGON items?

Edzer Pebesma is the creator of `sf` and was kind enough to advise me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/edzerpebesma/status/1080835401756147712) that there's an unexported function `largest_ring` that returns the largest polygon. Let's re-do our data cleaning from above, but add three steps:

- Use `st_zm()` and `st_set_crs()` to remove the Z coordinates and set the projection of the data
- Use `st_cast()` to convert all POLYGONs to MULTIPOLYGONs
- Extract the largest polygon with `largest_ring()`

```{r blog-largest-polygon-geometries}
college_features <- college_data %>%
  select(shape) %>%
  .[[1]]
college_geometries <- st_as_sfc(college_features) %>%
  st_zm() %>%
  st_set_crs(4326) %>%
  st_cast("MULTIPOLYGON") %>%
  sf:::largest_ring()

st_geometry(college_nongeometric_data) <- college_geometries
college_shapes <- college_nongeometric_data
```

Now let's check out the colleges from before which had multiple sites, looks like we've been successful!

```{r check-problem-colleges}
college_shapes %>%
  filter(name %in% c("Corpus Christi College", "Exeter College", "Magdalen College", "Merton College", "Pembroke College")) %>%
  mapview(zcol = "name")
```

It makes sense to export this now nicely formatted GIS data for use in the actual visualisation scripts. GeoJSON is my preferred GIS data format, and we can create that directly using `write_sf()` 

```{r blog-export-sf, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
college_shapes %>%
  write_sf(here("data-raw", "shapefiles_oxford_colleges.json"),
           driver = "GeoJSON")
```

Visualising college shapefiles with `ggmap`

<div id="visualise-with-ggmap" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

`ggmap` is the best tool for obtaining static map tiles for inclusion in `ggplot2` charts, most folks prefer the Google Maps tiles. Unfortunately, since July 2018 users need to provide Google with billing details in order to obtain map tiles. Read my [blogpost on how to setup your Google Maps API Key](https://www.visibledata.co.uk/blog/2018/12/05/2018-12-05-using-ggmap-after-july-2018/) before running the code below.

At the time of writing (January 2018), the version of `ggmap` on CRAN doesn't support the new API changes. Run `packageVersion("ggmap")` in your console, if the version is higher than 2.7 then you're in luck! If not, you need to install the development version of the package as follows:

```{r 2018-12-29-oxford-centres-9, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("dkahle/ggmap", ref = "tidyup")
```

Let's create a new script file for visualising the college shapes, `oxford-college-shapes.R`. We'll need to load the following packages at the top of the script

```{r blog-ggmap-api-key}
library("tidyverse")
library("here")
library("ggmap")
library("sf")
library("glue")
library("ggrepel")
```

Our GIS data was exported in the previous section, let's import it ready for use in this script:

```{r blog-import-shapefiles, eval = FALSE}
college_shapes <- read_sf(here("data-raw", "shapefiles_oxford_colleges.json"))
```

Before creating our maps we need to register our Google Maps token using `register_google()`:

```{r blog-register-google-key}
register_google(key = "My-FAKE-KEY")
```

```{r internal-register-google-key, echo = FALSE}
my_vault <- here("static", "data", "secret-vault.vault")
martinjhnhadley_private_key <- file.path("~/.ssh", "blog_vault")
ggmaps_rstats_key <- get_secret("ggmaps_rstats_key", key = martinjhnhadley_private_key, vault = my_vault)
register_google(ggmaps_rstats_key)
```

`get_googlemap()` gets us a map from the Google Maps API but requires both a center and (integer) zoom level, I've fiddled around for a while and think the following work well for us.

```{r 2018-12-29-oxford-centres-10}
base_map <- get_googlemap(center = c(-1.257411, 51.7601055), 
                          maptype = "roadmap",
                          zoom = 14)
```

In order to create `ggplot2` charts containing map tiles from `ggmap` we need to start with the `ggmap()` function and add layers with `+`

```{r 2018-12-29-oxford-centres-11}
gg_oxford_city <- ggmap(base_map)
gg_oxford_city +
  geom_sf(data = college_shapes, inherit.aes = FALSE, alpha = 0)
```

This is too busy a map to really communicate anything, it would be great if we could remove some of the labels and landmarks from the base map. To do that, we need to use the `style` argument of `ggmap()`.

The [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/hiding-features) doesn't make it easy to figure out how to manipulate multiple styles at once. [This page](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/styling) advises, "do not combine multiple operations into a single style operation". What's that mean?!

- If modifying just *one* style, we can give the `style` argument a vector

```{r style-ggmap-one-argument, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
get_googlemap(center = c(-1.257411, 51.7601055), 
                          maptype = "roadmap",
                          zoom = 14,
              style = c(feature = "feature:poi.park", visiblity = "off")) %>%
  ggmap()
```

- If modifying more than one style, we need to give a string containing multiple styles

```{r style-ggmap-multiple-arguments, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
get_googlemap(center = c(-1.257411, 51.7601055), 
                          maptype = "roadmap",
                          zoom = 14,
              style = "&style=feature:poi|visibility:off&style=feature:poi.park|visibility:on&style=feature:landscape.man_made|visibility:off") %>%
  ggmap()
```

Let's create a utility function for creating these style strings.

```{r make-ggmap-styles}
make_ggmap_styles <- function(styles){
  styles %>%
    mutate(style = glue("&style=feature:{feature}|visibility:{visibility}")) %>%
    select(style) %>%
    .[[1]] %>%
    paste0(collapse = "")
}
```

Here are the things we'd like to show/hide:

```{r my-style}
my_styles <- tribble(
  ~feature, ~visibility,
  "poi", "off",
  "poi.park", "on",
  "landscape.man_made", "off"
) 
```

Now we have a good looking `gg_oxford_city` that we can play with:

```{r styled-base-map, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
base_map <- get_googlemap(center = c(-1.257411, 51.7601055), 
                          maptype = "roadmap",
                          zoom = 14,
                          style = my_styles %>%
                            make_ggmap_styles())
gg_oxford_city <- ggmap(base_map)
gg_oxford_city
```

It's really incredibly how flexible the `ggplot2` extensions system is, we can label `sf` objects using `ggrepel::goem_label_repel` with barely any effort. The only effort I did expend was on choosing a good value for `nudge_x`.

```{r 2018-12-29-oxford-centres-12 }
gg_oxford_city +
  geom_sf(data = college_shapes, inherit.aes = FALSE,
          aes(fill = foundation.year < 1300)) +
  geom_label_repel(
    data = college_shapes %>%
                  filter(foundation.year < 1300),
    aes(label = name, geometry = geometry),
    stat = "sf_coordinates",
    nudge_x = 2,
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  )
```

</div>
</div>
</div>



<div class="panel panel-default">
<div class="panel-heading">

</h4>
</div>
    
<div id="center-of-mass-overtime" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Now we've finally got to the point that we can compute the centre of the colleges over time! Let's create a new script file `college-centres-over-time.R` and load our libraries.

```{r blog-libraries-for-centres-over-time}
library("tidyverse")
library("ggmap")
library("sf")
library("glue")
library("ggrepel")
```

Again, we need to import our GIS data:

```{r blog-reload-shapefiles, eval = FALSE}
college_shapes <- read_sf(here("data-raw", "shapefiles_oxford_colleges.json"))
```

We also need to ensure that we register with the Google Maps API when running this script and set-up our base map again.

```{r blog-register-google-key-again, eval = FALSE}
register_google(key = "My-FAKE-KEY")
make_ggmap_styles <- function(styles){
  styles %>%
    mutate(style = glue("&style=feature:{feature}|visibility:{visibility}")) %>%
    select(style) %>%
    .[[1]] %>%
    paste0(collapse = "")
}
my_styles <- tribble(
  ~feature, ~visibility,
  "poi", "off",
  "poi.park", "on",
  "landscape.man_made", "off"
)
base_map <- get_googlemap(center = c(-1.257411, 51.7601055), 
                          maptype = "roadmap",
                          zoom = 14,
                          style = my_styles %>%
                            make_ggmap_styles())
gg_oxford_city <- ggmap(base_map)
```

Let's see how the centre of mass of the colleges changes each century. I've created `century_cut()` which wraps `cut()` to create prettified centuries.

```{r century-cut}
century_cut <- function(x, lower = 0, upper, by = 100,
                   sep = "-", above.char = "+") {

 labs <- c(paste(seq(lower, upper - by, by = by),
                 seq(lower + by - 1, upper - 1, by = by),
                 sep = sep),
           paste(upper, above.char, sep = ""))

 cut(floor(x), breaks = c(seq(lower, upper, by = by), Inf),
     right = FALSE, labels = labs)
}


colleges_by_century <- college_shapes %>%
  group_by(century = century_cut(foundation.year, lower = 1200, upper = 2100, by = 100))

## Messy code to display just the name and century of creation
display_colleges_by_century <- colleges_by_century %>%
  select(name, century)
st_geometry(display_colleges_by_century) <- NULL
display_colleges_by_century %>%
  arrange(century)
```

Now we've done this we can calculate the centres for each century:

```{r 2018-12-29-oxford-centres-14, eval = FALSE}
century_centres <- colleges_by_century %>%
  select(century) %>%
  summarise_all(first) %>%
  st_centroid()

gg_century_centres <- gg_oxford_city +
  geom_sf(data = colleges_by_century,
          aes(fill = century), inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_sf(data = century_centres,
          aes(fill = century,
              color = century), inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_label_repel(
    data = century_centres,
    aes(label = century, fill = century, geometry = geometry),
    stat = "sf_coordinates",
    color = "white",
    nudge_x = -1,
    inherit.aes = FALSE,
    size = 5,
    fontface = 'bold'
  )
gg_century_centres <- gg_century_centres +
  labs(title = "Centre of Oxford colleges established in each century") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
gg_century_centres
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
century_centres <- colleges_by_century %>%
  select(century) %>%
  summarise_all(first) %>%
  st_centroid()
```

Now we've established the centre of the colleges for each century, let's compute the cumulative centres as time progresses. For simplicity, let's throw away all of the data except for the longitude and latitude of the centre of mass in each century. The `centre_over_time_period()` function returns the centre of mass for all colleges established within the specific time period:

```{r 2018-12-29-oxford-centres-15, eval = TRUE}
centre_over_time_period <- function(shapes, lower, upper){
  # print("a")
  suppressWarnings(shapes %>%
  filter(foundation.year >= lower & foundation.year < upper) %>%
  st_centroid() %>%
  st_combine() %>%
  st_centroid() %>%
  st_coordinates() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  rename(long = X,
           lat = Y))
}

centre_over_time_period(college_shapes,
                        lower = 1500,
                        upper = 1600)
```

Using `pmap()` we can calculate the cumulative college centres:

```{r}
time_periods <- tibble(
  lower = 1200,
  upper = seq(1300, 2100, 100)
)

centres_through_history <- time_periods %>%
  mutate(centre = pmap(list(lower, upper), function(lower, upper) {
  centre_over_time_period(college_shapes,
  lower,
  upper)
  })) %>%
  unnest() %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("long", "lat")) %>%
  st_set_crs(4326) %>%
  mutate(time_period = glue("{lower} - {upper}"))
```

We can visualise these cumulative centres using `geom_label_repel()`, just as above. But with carefully selected nudge factors:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gg_centres_through_time <- gg_oxford_city +
  # geom_sf(data = centres_through_history) +
  geom_label_repel(
    data = centres_through_history,
    aes(label = time_period, fill = time_period, geometry = geometry),
    color = "white",
    segment.color = "black",
    stat = "sf_coordinates",
    min.segment.length = 0.2,
    nudge_x = sample(c(-1,1), nrow(centres_through_history), replace = TRUE),
    nudge_y = sample(c(0.007, -0.007), nrow(centres_through_history), replace = TRUE),
    inherit.aes = FALSE,
    seed = 5,
    size = 5,
    fontface = 'bold'
  ) +
  labs(title = "Centres of University of Oxford through time") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d()
gg_centres_through_time
```

I'm slightly late to the `gganimate` bandwagon, but let's animate this! The `transition_states()` function will create a GIF that transitions through the `time_period` column, and I've used `shadow_wake()` so that the centre of mass can be tracked more easily by the reader.

```{r 2018-12-29-oxford-centres-19, eval = FALSE}
library("gganimate")
anim <- gg_oxford_city +
  geom_sf(data = centres_through_history, inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  transition_states(time_period,
                    transition_length = 2,
                    state_length = 1)
anim + 
  enter_fade() + 
  shadow_wake(wake_length = 0.05) +
  exit_shrink()
anim_save(here("oxford-centres.gif"))
```

I'd really love to be happy with this GIF, but it's really not good! The main issue is that `ggamp` only allows integer zoom levels, so the map is either far too zoomed in or out. It's also quite slow to experiment with `geom_sf` at the moment, I'm quite excited for [Thomas Pederson's promise to speed up `geom_sf`](https://twitter.com/thomasp85/status/1093874268809674752).
