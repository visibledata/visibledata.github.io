[Shiny Modules](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html) are an "advanced" feature of Shiny apps that developers can use to reduce code duplication, simplify complex inter-relating controls, allow UI elements to be compartmentalised into R packages... and generally be a Shiny magician.

Much of the stuff written about modules gets lost in the weeds. We're not going to do that here. We're going to make the Shiny app I've embedded below (as an iframe), both with and without modules.

<iframe width="100%" height="550px" scrolling="no" frameborder="yes"  src="https://visibledata.shinyapps.io/shiny-with-modules_gg_ma_timeseries/"> </iframe>

This app is slightly complicated, but deliberately so. I want to give you a real world example of using Shiny modules.

We'll go through the following steps:

1. Data import and wrangling

1. server.R skeleton

1. `gg_ma_timeseries()`

## How to follow along

To follow along you are advised to **create a new RStudio Project** and create the files detailed below in turn.

## What's the app?

The app allows the viewer to interact with data from the [Online Labour Index](https://ilabour.oii.ox.ac.uk/online-labour-index/). This is a project undertaken by the University of Oxford's Internet Institute to study the online labour market, and ultimately to provide an economic indicator for the gig economy. The data is deposited on Figshare, which means anyone can access (and importantly, cite) the data with the following DOI: [10.6084/m9.figshare.3761562](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3761562).

## Data import, wrangling and stuff

Let's completely ignore the details of accessing and wrangling the data. This is a tutorial on Shiny modules.

Create yourself a new script file called `data-processing.R` and insert this code. Please note that when this script is run it will download a dataset that in early 2019 is 37Mb in size, this will double every 3 years[^filesize].

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## This code should be inserted into your data-processing.R script
fs_deposit_id <- 3761562
deposit_details <- fs_details(fs_deposit_id)

deposit_details <- unlist(deposit_details$files)
deposit_details <-
  data.frame(split(deposit_details, names(deposit_details)), stringsAsFactors = F)

imported_country_group_data <- deposit_details %>%
  filter(str_detect(name, "bcountrydata_")) %>%
  pull(download_url) %>%
  read_csv() %>%
  mutate(timestamp = as_date(timestamp)) %>%
  rename(date = timestamp)

gigs_by_country_group <- imported_country_group_data %>%
  group_by(date, country_group) %>%
  summarise(jobs = sum(count)) %>%
  ungroup()

gigs_by_occupation <- imported_country_group_data %>%
  group_by(date, occupation) %>%
  summarise(count = sum(count)) %>%
  rename(jobs = count) %>%
  ungroup()
```

Please note, we don't run this code yet. It's going to be loaded in our `server.R` file.

## server.R skeleton

Here's the skeleton for our `server.R` file, go ahead and create this on your machine:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## this is how your server.R file should look
library("shiny")
library("tidyverse")
library("rfigshare")
library("lubridate")
library("xts")
library("ggsci")

source("data-processing.R", local = TRUE)

function(input, output, session){
  
  
}
```

Some things to note about our file:

- We've loaded all of the packages needed for the whole app, not just the data wrangling.

- We've used `source()` to run the data wrangling script when the Shiny app loads

- Our shiny server function contains **three** arguments. Many Shiny tutorials ommit the `session` argument, but it's integral for Shiny modules to work correctly.

We're about to run our script file, but first **register for a Figshare.com account** so you can use the `rfigshare` package. Now **run this script**.

## gg_ma_timeseries

Let's assume for a minute that the dataviz we're creating here is important enough that we might want to use it in other places than just this Shiny app. The easiest way to support this is by placing the script for the dataviz in its own file.

Create a new file called `gg_ma_timeseries.R` and add the following code, we'll walk through the potentially mysterious `enquo` part of the functions in two minutes.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
## this is how your gg_ma_timeseries.R file should look
gg_ma_timeseries <- function(.data, date, value, category) {
  date <- enquo(date)
  
  value <- enquo(value)
  
  category <- enquo(category)
  
  n_colours <- .data %>%
    pull(!!category) %>%
    unique() %>%
    length()
  
  colours_from_startrek <- colorRampPalette(pal_startrek(palette = c("uniform"))(7))(n_colours)
  
  
  .data %>%
    ggplot(aes(
      x = !!date,
      y = !!value,
      color = !!category
    )) +
    geom_line() +
    theme_bw() +
    scale_color_manual(values = colours_from_startrek) +
    scale_x_date(expand = c(0.01, 0.01)) +
    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0.01, 0)) +
    labs(
      title = "Example dataviz of Online Labour Index data",
      subtitle = "DOI:10.6084/m9.figshare.376156")
}

ma_job_count <- function(.data, date, value, category, window_width){
  
  date <- enquo(date)
  
  value <- enquo(value)
  
  category <- enquo(category)
  
  window_width <- as.numeric(window_width)
  
  .data %>%
    group_by(!!category) %>%
    arrange(!!date) %>%
    mutate(!!value := rollmean(!!value,
                           k = window_width,
                           na.pad = TRUE,
                           align = "right"
    )) %>%
    filter(!is.na(!!value)) %>%
    ungroup()
  
}
```

- `gg_ma_timeseries()` is the function which creates our `ggplot2` timeseries dataviz

- `ma_job_count()` is a little utility function for smoothing the data with `xts::rollmean()`.

Let's load this file in our `server.R` script, so the file now has all of the code in it from before. **Run this entire script**.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## this is how your server.R file should look
library("shiny")
library("tidyverse")
library("rfigshare")
library("lubridate")
library("xts")
library("ggsci")

source("data-processing.R", local = TRUE)

source("gg_ma_timeseries.R", local = TRUE)

function(input, output, session){
  
  
}
```

I want to prove to you that this works. Create a new script file `scratch-pad.R` where we can experiment and play. Add the following code, and then **run the script**.

```{r, include = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("lubridate")
library("ggsci")
library("xts")
imported_country_group_data <- read_csv(here::here("static", "data", "imported_country_group_data.csv"))

gigs_by_country_group <- imported_country_group_data %>%
  group_by(date, country_group) %>%
  summarise(jobs = sum(count)) %>%
  ungroup()

gigs_by_occupation <- imported_country_group_data %>%
  group_by(date, occupation) %>%
  summarise(count = sum(count)) %>%
  rename(jobs = count) %>%
  ungroup()
```

```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## this is how your scratch-pad.R file should look
gigs_by_occupation %>%
  ma_job_count(date, jobs, occupation, 28) %>%
  gg_ma_timeseries(date, jobs, occupation)
```

Notice how the column names `jobs`, `occupation` and `date` have been given to `gg_ma_timeseries` without quotation marks? This is exactly the same as how we use functions from `dplyr`, e.g. `iris %>% mutate(species = toupper(species))`. These are what we call **naked column names**.

That's why the functions use `enquo()` internally, it's implementing non-standard evaluation with [tidyeval](https://tidyeval.tidyverse.org). However, there's zero need to understand this now (if you don't want to). This is a Shiny module tutorial, so let's move on to the `ui.R` file.

## ui.R skeleton

Here's the skeleton for our `ui.R` file, go ahead and create this on your machine:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## this is how your ui.R file should look
library("shiny")
library("shinycustomloader")
shinyServer(navbarPage(
  "Shiny Modules",
  tabPanel(
    "By occupation",
    fluidPage()
  ),
  tabPanel(
    "By country",
    fluidPage()
  )
))
```

## Shiny app without modules

A complete copy of this Shiny app that doesn't use modules is available on Github here: [https://github.com/charliejhadley/training_shiny-module/tree/master/gg_ma_timeseries/shiny-without-modules](https://github.com/charliejhadley/training_shiny-module/tree/master/gg_ma_timeseries/shiny-without-modules).

There's a tremendous amount of duplication in the `ui.R` file to get the `radioButtons()` to look how I want them to. We need to use Shiny modules to simplify this, which we'll do in the section below.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## DO NOT COPY THIS CODE.
## This is how the ui.R file looks without using modules.
library("shiny")
library("shinycustomloader")

shinyServer(navbarPage(
  "Shiny without Modules",
  tabPanel(
    "By occupation",
    fluidPage(fluidRow(column(
      radioButtons(
        "by_occupation_landing_rollmean_k",
        label = "",
        choices = list(
          "Show daily value" = 1,
          "Show 28-day moving average" = 28
        ),
        selected = 28,
        inline = TRUE
      ),
      width = 12
    )),
    withLoader(plotOutput("gg_gigs_by_occupation")),
    type = "html", loader = "dnaspin"
    )
  ),
  tabPanel(
    "By country",
    fluidPage(fluidRow(column(
      radioButtons(
        "by_country_group_landing_rollmean_k",
        label = "",
        choices = list(
          "Show daily value" = 1,
          "Show 28-day moving average" = 28
        ),
        selected = 28,
        inline = TRUE
      ),
      width = 12
    )),
    withLoader(plotOutput("gg_gigs_by_country_group")),
    type = "html", loader = "dnaspin"
    )
  )
))
```

The `server.R` file is fairly tidy because we've already abstracted a lot of the app into functions:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## DO NOT COPY THIS CODE.
## This is how the server.R file looks without using modules.
library("shiny")
library("tidyverse")
library("rfigshare")
library("lubridate")
library("xts")
library("ggsci")

source("data-processing.R", local = TRUE)

source("gg_ma_timeseries.R", local = TRUE)

function(input, output, session) {
  output$gg_gigs_by_occupation <- renderPlot({
    
    gigs_by_occupation %>%
      ma_job_count(date, jobs, occupation, input$by_occupation_landing_rollmean_k) %>%
      gg_ma_timeseries(date, jobs, occupation)
    
  })

  output$gg_gigs_by_country_group <- renderPlot({
    
    gigs_by_country_group %>%
      ma_job_count(date, jobs, country_group, input$by_country_group_landing_rollmean_k) %>%
      gg_ma_timeseries(date, jobs, country_group)
    
  })
}
```

## Introducing the Shiny Module

The Shiny Module is composed of two components:

- `gg_ma_timeseries_input()` creates an instance of our controls.
- `gg_ma_timeseries_output()` creates an instance of the chart, which is dependent on a set of controls (specified in the server.R file).

</center>

It's crucial that we place the code for these elements of the module in the correct place:

</center>

### Rules for modules

This is one of the things left out of the other Shiny module tutorials I've read. Most tutorials deal with a toy example and don't split the code into distinct `ui.R` and `server.R` files. Let's establish some hard and fast rules about modules:

- Place your module code in a subfolder called `/modules`.

- Code for inputs (controls) must be sourced in the `ui.R` file.

- Code for outputs (charts) must be sourced in the `server.R` file.

## Namespaces with `NS`

Remember our `server.R` function?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
server <- function(input, output, session){
  
}
```

Inside of our modules we need to manipulate values from both the `input` and `output` objects. In programming speak, we need to be careful about namespaces. In Shiny, this means we need to use the `NS()` function to guarantee we're refering to the values we think we're refering to. Let's create the control for our modules, in a new script file: `/modules/client-side_gg-ma-timeseries.R`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## This is how your /modules/client-side_gg-ma-timeseries.R file should look
gg_ma_timeseries_input <- function(id) {
  ns <- NS(id)
  tagList(
    "This entire tab is a shiny module, including; this text, the radio buttons and the chart.",
    fluidRow(column(
      radioButtons(
        ns("landing_rollmean_k"),
        label = "",
        choices = list(
          "Show daily value" = 1,
          "Show 28-day moving average" = 28
        ),
        selected = 28,
        inline = TRUE
      ),
      width = 12
    ))
  )
}
```

Things to take away from the `gg_ma_timeseries_input()` function:

- `ns <- NS(id)` ensures we're refering to values from the server `input` object

- `ns("landing_rollmean_k")` translates to `input$landing_rollmean_k`

- If returning **multiple ui elements** they must be contained within `tagList()`... *but* it's a great idea to use `tagList()` by default, it will prevent mishaps.

That's our control. We need to create our output function that will display the chart rendered by the server, which we'll call `gg_ma_timeseries_output()`. It takes a while to download and display the data in our chart, so it's a good idea to use the excellent [`shinycustomloader`] package to show an animated "loading" GIF to the user. Please update your `/modules/client-side_gg-ma-timeseries.R` file so it looks like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## This is how your /modules/client-side_gg-ma-timeseries.R file should look
library("shinycustomloader")

gg_ma_timeseries_input <- function(id) {
  ns <- NS(id)
  tagList(
    "This entire tab is a shiny module, including; this text, the radio buttons and the chart.",
    fluidRow(column(
      radioButtons(
        ns("landing_rollmean_k"),
        label = "",
        choices = list(
          "Show daily value" = 1,
          "Show 28-day moving average" = 28
        ),
        selected = 28,
        inline = TRUE
      ),
      width = 12
    ))
  )
}

gg_ma_timeseries_output <- function(id) {
  ns <- NS(id)
  withLoader(plotOutput(ns("ma_plot")), type = "html", loader = "dnaspin")
}
```

Our output function is more complex than our input, because `ns("ma_plot")` refers to an instace of `output$ma_plot` from the Shiny module, which we haven't created yet

The trick to how `NS()` works inside of `gg_ma_timeseries_output()` is more complicated than our input function, and is explained in the section below. However, let's 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## This is how your ui.R file should look
library("shiny")

source("modules/client-side_gg-ma-timeseries.R", local = TRUE)

shinyServer(navbarPage(
  "Shiny Modules",
  tabPanel(
    "By occupation",
    fluidPage(
      gg_ma_timeseries_input("occupation_controls"),
      gg_ma_timeseries_output("occupation_chart")
    )
  ),
  tabPanel(
    "By country",
    fluidPage(
      gg_ma_timeseries_input("by_country_controls"),
      gg_ma_timeseries_output("by_country_chart")
    )
  )
))
```


- We're going to be extracting 

- `ns <- NS(id)` ensures we're 

- `ns("ma_plot")` 

## Things they don't tell you

- Load the ui in the ui.R file

- Delete the scratch-pad.R file
