                        <p>statesRcontiguous is an #rstats package published to CRAN that makes available shapefiles for the United States of America from combining multiple datasets from the <a href='https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data' target='_blank'>US Census</a> into a single 'sf dataframe' object. Usefully, the shapefile has a logical column 'contiguous.united.states' for easily filtering. This was the first package Martin John Hadley published to CRAN.</p>
