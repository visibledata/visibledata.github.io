I’m a reproducible research evangelist and data science consultant with over 6 years of experience working in both industry and academia. My tools of choice at present are R and Shiny, read more about my experience on my LinkedIn profile or <a href="/team/cvs/2018-01-30_CV_Martin-John-Hadley.docx" target="_blank">download a copy of my CV</a>.

As with most R folks, I find Twitter an excellent place to learn more about #rstats and feel part of the community. I also tweet about reproducibility, LGBTQ+, and sex positivity <a href="https://twitter.com/martinjhnhadley?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow <span class="citation">@martinjhnhadley</span></a>

I founded Visible Data in 2016 as a way to better organise his working relationship with Lynda.com and LinkedIn Learning, but branched out into offering courses through the Royal Statistical Society and eventually into data science consultancy in late 2017. Starting in 2018, I decided to properly commit to starting a Visible Data blog and I’m looking to bring additional folks into the consultancy to increase the range of services and training that we can provide.
