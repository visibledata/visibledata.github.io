(LINKS). To help me better understand the differences between RMarkdown and quarto I decided I'd convert [Alison Hill's R-Ladies {xaringan} theme](https://www.apreshill.com/project/rladies-xaringan/) into a quarto **format**\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.apreshill.com/slides/rladies-demo-slides.html#1\" width=\"400px\" height=\"350px\">\n\n</iframe>\n\nHowever, what I realised is that first I needed to replicate the {xaringan} format as closely as possible in {quarto}.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.1 ──\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n✔ ggplot2 3.3.6     ✔ purrr   0.3.4\n✔ tibble  3.1.7     ✔ dplyr   1.0.9\n✔ tidyr   1.2.0     ✔ stringr 1.4.0\n✔ readr   2.1.2     ✔ forcats 0.5.1\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntribble(\n  ~feature, ~description,\n  \"Code chunk  appearance\", \"Different.

Using accessibility features of quarto\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# How to use the xaringan quarto theme\n\nIn the RMarkdown universe we create `{xaringan}` slides by changing the `output` type of our RMarkdown document:\n\n\n\n````default\n---\noutput:\n  xaringan::moon_reader\n---\n````\n\n\nBut in quarto, things are very different. Formats are made available as [specific types of extensions](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/formats.html), which **must be installed in each distinct project**. You must therefore run this code in the Terminal (not the R console) in RStudio for each presentation you want to write:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nquarto install extension rcharliejhadley/xaringan-quarto\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis will add the format to the `_extensions` folder and you can now create your slide deck with in a `.qmd` as follows:\n\n\n\n````default\n---\ntitle: Your awesome R-Ladies talk\nformat: rladies-revealjs\n---\n````\n\n\n# Recreating `{xaringan}` in `{quarto}`\n\nThe new `{quarto}` system makes use of `reveal.js` for creating HTML slides, whereas `{xaringan}` uses `remark.js`. D[espite these libraries sounding similar,](https://twitter.com/charliejhadley/status/1553179086390009856?s=20&t=7tThga5ITSGdLu3HXJolZw) they're very different. This means there's a lot of styling that needs to be bought across into the new `xaringan-quarto` theme. But before we progress, let's think about why we want to replicate the `{xaringan}` output type:\n\n-   {xaringan} slides look good!\n\n-   {xaringan} has lots of nice features for formatting slides\n\nSo in this new `{quarto}` format I want to replicate both the styles and the formatting features - as closely as possible, anyhow.\n\n## Adding remark.js dependency.\n\nIt took me **ages** to figure out how to add a JavaScript dependency to a format. I eventually figured it out from looking at the [grouped-tabsets extension](https://github.com/quarto-ext/grouped-tabsets). These are the steps we need to go through:\n\n1.  We need to use a `.lua` file to add our dependencies, add a file called `remark-js.lua` into the `xaringan` folder. Within this file we're going to add our dependency:\n\n``` verbatim\nDiv = function(el)\n  if quarto.doc.isFormat(\"html:js\") then\n    quarto.doc.addHtmlDependency({\n        name = \"remarkjs\",\n        scripts = {\"remark-latest.min.js\"}\n      })\n  end\nend \n```\n\n1.  Add the `remark-latest.min.js` file to the `xaringan` folder. In the future I'll figure out how to get the hosted file, but for now I copy pasted the contents of <https://remarkjs.com/downloads/remark-latest.min.js>.\n\n2.  In the `_extension.yml` file we need to add our lua dependency, as part of our format. To do so we need to [use the `common` key](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/formats.html#common-metadata).\n\n``` verbatim\ncontributes:\n  formats:\n    revealjs:\n    common:\n       filters:\n           - remark-js.lua\n```\n\n## Adding .scss fles to formats\n\nNow we've got the `remark.js` loaded we can move onto setting up the `{xaringan}` CSS styles. However, there's a little trick to it. `{quarto}` makes use of `.scss` files intead of normal `.css` files, but that's to our advantage. By using `.scss` files we can take advantage of [Bootstrap SASS variables](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html#sass-variables) [which are very powerful](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes-more.html), but I'm not sure how much we'll make use of them here.\n\nWhen creating a `.scss` file we need to create at least one \"layer boundary\" otherwise we'll get this error message:\n\n``` verbatim\nERROR: The file _extensions/xaringan/xaringan-default.scss doesn't contain at least one layer boundary (/*-- scss:defaults --*/, /*-- scss:rules --*/, /*-- scss:mixins --*/, /*-- scss:functions --*/, or /*-- scss:uses --*/)\n```\n\nHere are the steps required to start-up our custom styling\n\n1.  Create a `xaringan-default.scss` file in the `xaringan` folder. We'll set paragraph text to red so we can test it the styles are working:\n\n``` css\n/*-- scss:rules --*/\n\np {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\n2.  Update the `_extension.yml` file to make use of the `.scss` file\n\n``` verbatim\ncontributes:\n  formats:\n    revealjs:\n       theme: [default, xaringan-default.scss]\n    common:\n       filters:\n           - remark-js.lua\n```\n\n## Adding a template presentation\n\nIt's a good idea to add a template presentation file so folks know how to use the format. But it has another utility! We can render the template file within our RStudio project to continually test the theme without having to use the quarto cli.\n\nSo, let's add `template.qmd` to the top-level directory of our project and some lorem ipsum text:\n\n```` verbatim\n---\ntitle: \"Xarignan Slides\"\nformat: xaringan-revealjs\n---\n\n\n\n## First slide\n\nThis paragraph text will be red!\n````\n\nWe're now going to iteratively add/remove content to this template while we build up the theme.\n\n## Letter-boxing and slide scaling\n\n`{xaringan}` slides are very distinct because of the letter boxing affect from `remark.js`, and the size of the content rescales with the size of the browser windows. For a first attempt at replicating this, I've added [some CSS in this commit](80685b9a269530ce932f211024b5250d91b985a7). I also needed to add padding around the slide content, I've implemented this through the [border of the `<div>`](af09b15db3b1bba39ae18a96cb4bcc2e7f3e171e) but it's likely not the best solution.\n\nWhen it comes to replicating exactly how the slide aspect ratio changes, I'm not sure what to do. These are the [options available for scaling the presentation size in `reveal.js`](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/advanced.html#presentation-size) but at the moment I don't understand how remark.js does its scaling, and so I can't replicate it further.\n\n|             |                                                                                          |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Option      | Description                                                                              |\n| `margin`    | Factor of the display size that should remain empty around the content (defaults to 0.1) |\n| `min-scale` | Smallest possible scale to apply to content (defaults to 0.2)                            |\n| `max-scale` | Largest possible scale to apply to content (defaults to 2.0)                             |\n\n## Hello world slide\n\nLet's look at duplicating the styling of this slide from the `{xaringan`} template:\n\n![](images/paste-C45D0768.png){width=\"335\"}\n\nThere are four thing to look at:\n\n-   Code chunk and in-line code formatting\n\n-   Text and link formatting\n\n-   Incremental bullet points\n\n-   Footnotes\n\n### Code chunk formatting\n\nIn `{xaringan}` the code chunk formatting is very flat. I'm choosing to deliberately use `{quarto}` code formatting as it improves accessibility and provides further customisation for formats that build on `xaringan-quarto` and for individual preferences. In the `_extension.yml` I've activated the github highlighting style.\n\n\n\n````default\ncontributes:\n  formats:\n    revealjs:\n       theme: [default, xaringan-default.scss, xaringan-default-fonts.scss]\n       highlight-style: github\n       \n````\n\n\nYou could use this YAML option for customising all code chunks or individual chunks. The documentation explains how to [completely customise chunk appearance](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html#appearance) and [syntax highlighting](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html#custom-highlighting).\n\nNow let's look at the inline code formatting. In the original `xaringan` format this text is the same colour as paragraph text but printed in a mono spaced font. In this first alpha release of the format [I've chosen to change this to purple](c16571511f3bb5cc9a4647f7db5398a86bd8077f), but this probably won't be popular.\n\n### Text and link formatting\n\nWe're going to use the SASS `link-color` variable to change the colour of hyperlinks, but remember this must be placed in the defaults layer of the .scss file.\n\n\n\n````default\n/*-- scss:defaults --*/\n$link-color: rgb(249, 38, 114);\n````\n\n\nIn `{xaringan}` the paragraph text is set to 20px, setting the `$presentation-font-size-root` to 28px in the .scss results in slides that scale similarly to {xaringan} slides.\n\n\n\n````default\n$presentation-font-size-root: 28px;\n````\n\n\nWith `{xaringan}` we're free to use whatever level of heading we like for slides. In fact, it's fairly common to use lower-level headings for longer slide titles. But, in `{quarto}` we can **only start slides with level 2 headings**. I've taken the heading sizes from `{xaringan}` and added them to the styles:\n\n\n\n````default\n$heading2Size: 55px;\n$heading3Size: 45px;\n$heading4Size: 35px;\n````\n\n\nNote that these are still scaled with the size of the browser window.\n\n### Incremental bullet points\n\nIn `{xaringan}` we can make anything incremental with two dashes, eg `--`. But in the `{quarto}` `reveal.js` format we need to create a `<div>` using the incremental class. There's two ways of doing this, either with explicit `<div></div>` tags or with matching pairs of `:::`.\n\n### Footnotes\n\nIn {quarto} we use `^[footnote text]` notation to add footnotes that are then numbered at the bottom of the slide. In my opinion, the default styling for quarto is better than `{xaringan}` so I'm sticking with it.\n\n# OLD DRAGONS\n\nIn this blogpost I'll first explain how to use the R-Ladies quaro presentation format and then [how to build your own quarto formats](doo).\n\n### How to use the rladies quarto theme\n\nIn the RMarkdown universe the R-Ladies {xaringan} theme is selected by changing the `css` option in the YAML header\n\n\n\n````default\n---\noutput:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    css: [\"default\", \"rladies\", \"rladies-fonts\"]\n---\n````\n\n\nBut in quarto, things are very different. Formats are made available as [specific types of extensions](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/formats.html), which **must be installed in each distinct project**. You must therefore run this code in the Terminal (not the R console) in RStudio for each presentation you want to write:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nquarto install extension r-ladies/r-ladies-quarto\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis will add the format to the `_extensions` folder and you can now create your slide deck with in a `.qmd` as follows:\n\n\n\n````default\n---\ntitle: Your awesome R-Ladies talk\nformat: rladies-revealjs\n---\n````\n\n\n### How to build your own theme\n\nThere is some [existing documentation for building your own formats](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/formats.html) and folder structure is extremely important. The minimum specification for an extension requires you to create an `_extension.yml` file nested as follows:\n\n\n\n````default\nrladies-quarto/\n              _extensions/\n                          rladies/\n                                  _extension.yml\n````\n\n\nThis extension will be called `rladies` because of the folder name `rladies`. Inside of the `_extension.yml` file we then specify that the extension contributes a format based on the `revealjs` presentation format using the default theme, note that there are [11 built-in revealjs themes available](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/themes.html).\n\n\n\n````default\ncontributes:\n  formats:\n    revealjs:\n       theme: default\n````\n\n\nWe can add some metadata about the extension, and we can make use of [any of the `revealjs` options](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/presentations/revealjs.html).\n\n\n\n````default\ntitle: RLadies quarto Presentation\nauthor: Charlotte Hadley\nversion: 0.0.1\ncontributes:\n  formats:\n    revealjs:\n       theme: default\n       incremental: true\n````\n\n\nIt's now time to add our custom styles. This is achieved using `.scss` files instead of ordinary `.css` files, thanks to `quarto` making use of [Bootstrap SASS variables](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html#sass-variables). There are two steps:\n\n-   Add the `.scss` file to the `theme` option in the `_extension.yml` file\n\n\n\n````default\ntitle: RLadies quarto Presentation\nauthor: Charlotte Hadley\nversion: 0.0.1\ncontributes:\n  formats:\n    revealjs:\n       theme: [default, rladies.scss]\n       incremental: true\n````\n\n\n-   Add styles to your `.scss` file that you can easily test\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.css .cell-code}\n$body-color: red;\n```\n\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n$body-color: red;\n</style>\n:::\n\n\nLet's kill two birds with one stone by creating a template slide deck that we can also use to test our `.scss` styles. At the top level of the project add a new file called `template.qmd` and set the format as `rladies-revealjs` and click the Render button, if everything is working you'll see a slide deck with red text.\n\n\n\n````default\n---\ntitle: \"R-Ladies Xarignan Theme\"\nformat: rladies-revealjs\n---\n\nTest\n````\n\n\n#### Replicating Alison Hill's theme CSS\n\n#### slide background color\n\nI tried to change the background color with the scss file, but it only changes the background of the slide content.\n\n\n\n````default\n# .scss file\n.inverse {\n  data-background: #562457;\n}\n\n# presentation\n::: {.inverse}\n\n````\n\n\n![](images/paste-3DDD0D0F.png){width=\"428\"}\n\nConfusingly, if we set the `data-background` attribute within the {} then it does work\n",
