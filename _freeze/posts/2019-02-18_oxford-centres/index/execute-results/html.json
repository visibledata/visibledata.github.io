A fairly common point of contention is where should we meet, and where is the centre of the University?\n\nWe broadly agreed that the centre of the University should be calculated as the (weighted) centre of mass of specific buildings or campuses within the University. Two of our favourite options were:\n\n- Centre of mass of all colleges\n- Centre of mass of the University divisions\n\nIn this blogpost I go through all the steps of scraping and combining data from the OxPoints service and Wikipedia to create the chart below:\n\n![](oxford-centres.gif){max-width=530px}\n\n### How to follow along\n\nIf you want to follow along, please follow these steps first:\n\n1. Create a new RStudio project\n\n2. Create a data directory by running `dir.create(\"data\")`\n\n3. Create a script file in the `data` directory called `obtain-oxpoints-data.R`, we'll use this to scrape data from Oxpoint.\n\n\n### Get data from OxPoints\n\nOxPoints is a tool for [accessing geographic information about University of Oxford](https://help.it.ox.ac.uk/oxpoints/index) and was mostly put together by my friend and ex-colleague [Alex Dutton](https://twitter.com/alexsdutton). Now I've highlighted Alex is a friend, I can be slightly more candid in scraping data from the service...\n\nWe're going to extract the shapefiles for all colleges in the university and store the data in ESRI shapefiles.\n\nWe need to load the following libraries at the top of our `data-raw/obtain-oxpoints-data.R` script:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(\"jsonlite\")\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(\"sf\")\nlibrary(\"here\")\nlibrary(\"rvest\")\nlibrary(\"mapview\")\n```\n:::\n\nThere's not a fantastically well documented way to obtain college data from the API. After jigging about with the search fields the query below returns everything we need, and then we then subset the data (after much trial and error):\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nraw_json_oxpoints_colleges <- read_json(\"https://maps.ox.ac.uk/api/places/search?type=%2Funiversity%2Fcollege&inoxford=true&-type_exact=%5C%2Funiversity%5C%2Fsub-library&-type_exact=%5C%2Funiversity%5C%2Froom&count=50&facet=type_exact\")\n\noxpoints_colleges <- raw_json_oxpoints_colleges$`_embedded`$pois\n```\n:::\n\nThe `oxpoints_colleges` object contains data for all 38 colleges (at the time of writing).

We've already loaded the `rvest` package at the top of our script file, which is the go-to tool for web scraping with R. First, let's import the web page using `read_html`. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolleges_of_oxford <- read_html(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleges_of_the_University_of_Oxford\")\n```\n:::\n\nWe want to extract the tables from the web page, which we achieve using `html_nodes()`. Specifically, we only care about the 3rd table.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolleges_of_oxford <- colleges_of_oxford %>%\n  html_nodes(\"table\")\ncolleges_of_oxford <- colleges_of_oxford[[3]]\n```\n:::\n\nThe `rvest` package does contain a useful function (`html_table()`) for parsing well-formed tables into tibbles. Unfortunately, our table is not very well formed at all. The first row spans the whole table and contains a glossary for abbreviations in the table, please don't format your own tables like this. I've decided to get around this by extracting all rows from the table, which have the html tag `<tr>` and extract the contents of these nodes into character vectors using `html_text()`.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolleges_of_oxford <- colleges_of_oxford %>%\n  html_nodes(\"tbody\") %>%\n  html_nodes(\"tr\") %>%\n  html_text()\n```\n:::\n\nWe'll throw away the top row by asking for parts `2:length(.)` and also clean up and nasty trailing/leading white space with `str_trim()`.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolleges_of_oxford <- colleges_of_oxford %>%\n  .[2:{length(.) - 1}] %>%\n  str_trim() \n```\n:::\n\nNow we can convert our vector of characters into a `tibble`! In the original table, the [newline character `\\n`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline) separates pieces of data in each row. So we can use `str_replace_all` to replace any sequence of repeating `\\n` with a `;` and then parse this as a table with `read_delim()`. Let's also tidy up the column names before we forget.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolleges_of_oxford <- colleges_of_oxford %>%\n  str_replace_all(\"\\n{1,}\", \";\") %>% \n  tibble(text = .) %>% \n  separate(text,\n           into = c(\"name\", \"foundation.year\", \"sister.college\", \"total.assets\", \"financial.endowment\", \"undergraduates\", \"post.graduates\", \"visiting.students\", \"male.students\", \"female.students\", \"total.students\", \"assets.per.student\"),\n           sep = \";\")\n```\n:::\n\nThere are several messy columns that we need to convert into numeric data:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolleges_of_oxford %>%\n  slice(8:9) %>%\n  select(name, foundation.year, total.assets, financial.endowment)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  name                      foundation.year   total.assets    financial.endowme…\n  <chr>                     <chr>             <chr>           <chr>             \n1 Harris Manchester College 1786College: 1996 £40,301,000[27] £14,371,000[27]   \n2 Hertford College          1282College: 1740 £79,183,000[28] £60,552,000[28]   \n```\n:::\n:::\n\nTurns out `readr::parse_number()` is clever enough to fix our column. It's convenient to use `mutate_at` to modify many columns at once, having previously re-arranged columns so all the targets are together:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolleges_of_oxford <- colleges_of_oxford %>%\n  select(name, sister.college, everything()) %>% \n  select(name, sister.college, foundation.year, undergraduates, post.graduates, total.students) %>% \n  mutate(across(foundation.year:total.students, ~parse_number(.x)))\n```\n:::\n\nWe've now got all of the information I wanted about the colleges, so let's combine the tables with `left_join()`. But this isn't a well formatted dataset for GIS analysis/visualisation. For that we need to use the `sf` package.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncollege_data <- college_oxpoints_data %>%\n  left_join(colleges_of_oxford)\n```\n:::\n\n### Creating an `sf` object\n\n`sf tibbles` are the augmented tibbles of the excellent `sf` package. They contain both the necessary geometric data for computing & visualising GIS features, and additional non-geometric data about each feature (i.e. the founding year of the college).\n\nLet's remove the `shape` column from `college_data` to provide us with the purely non-geometric data columns, and we'll append the\n\nLet's extract all the non-geometric data columns from `college_data` with `select()` and create a new tibble `college_nongeometric_data` that we'll append the geometric data to below.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncollege_nongeometric_data <- college_data %>%\n  select(-shape)\n```\n:::\n\nIn my opinion, this is the one and only fiddly part of using `sf`. We need to create an `sfc` object, which is achieved with the `st_as_sfc()` function. However, this function needs a *vector* of the features and not a `tibble`; which is why in the code below we use `.[[1]]`. If you're unfamiliar with this trick, please refer to [Hadley Wickham's pepper shaker tutorial](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/643381054758363136).\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncollege_features <- college_data %>%\n  select(shape) %>%\n  .[[1]]\ncollege_geometries <- st_as_sfc(college_features)\n```\n:::\n\nWe can now augment `college_nongeometric_data` with this `sfc` object via the `st_geometry()` function. Finally, we'll create a copy of this with a sensible name: `college_shapes` \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nst_geometry(college_nongeometric_data) <- college_geometries\ncollege_shapes <- college_nongeometric_data\n```\n:::\n\nOur `sf tibble` currently suffers from two issues:\n\n- There's no projection. We'll assign the standard WGS84 projection with `st_set_crs`.\n- The geometry objects are currently `POLYGON Z` and `MULTIPOLYGON Z` with zero values for `z`. As all values are zero, they're pointless and can be removed with `st_zm`.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncollege_shapes <- college_shapes %>%\n  st_set_crs(4326) %>%\n  st_zm()\n```\n:::\n\n### Understanding our shapefiles with `mapview`\n\nBefore continuing forwards, we should ensure our shapefiles are what we assume they are: the grounds of each college in the University of Oxford. The `mapview` package is incredibly useful for exploring and understanding `sf tibbles`. If you've been following along precisely, the script file your in already loads `mpaview`!\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmp_colleges <- college_shapes %>%\n  mapview()\nmp_colleges\n```\n\n:::

the calculation of where the centre of Oxford is. So how do we go about extracting the largest polygon from MULTIPOLYGON items?\n\nEdzer Pebesma is the creator of `sf` and was kind enough to advise me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/edzerpebesma/status/1080835401756147712) that there's an unexported function `largest_ring` that returns the largest polygon. Let's re-do our data cleaning from above, but add three steps:\n\n- Use `st_zm()` and `st_set_crs()` to remove the Z coordinates and set the projection of the data\n- Use `st_cast()` to convert all POLYGONs to MULTIPOLYGONs\n- Extract the largest polygon with `largest_ring()`\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncollege_features <- college_data %>%\n  select(shape) %>%\n  .[[1]]\ncollege_geometries <- st_as_sfc(college_features) %>%\n  st_zm() %>%\n  st_set_crs(4326) %>%\n  st_cast(\"MULTIPOLYGON\") %>%\n  sf:::largest_ring()\n\nst_geometry(college_nongeometric_data) <- college_geometries\ncollege_shapes <- college_nongeometric_data\n```\n:::\n\nNow let's check out the colleges from before which had multiple sites, looks like we've been successful!\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncollege_shapes %>%\n  filter(name %in% c(\"Corpus Christi College\", \"Exeter College\", \"Magdalen College\", \"Merton College\", \"Pembroke College\")) %>%\n
