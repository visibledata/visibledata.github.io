Let's get going with the datasets I'll need.\n\n## UK Road Network\n\nThe Ordance Survey makes available a huge dataset containing UK roads. Let's download, unzip and read in the road links. Please note this generates an `{sf}` object that's >4Gb in size.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWhat kinds of road do we have?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nLet's extract out the motorways and see if we can visualise them.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Great Britain mainland\n\nI'm interested in looking at only the mainland of Great Britain. The ONS provides high quality data from here https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/ons::countries-december-2023-boundaries-uk-bfc-2/about. I'm going to extract the mainland by st_cast(\"POLYGON\") and discounting polygons with an area smaller than 2e10 m^2\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Service stations\n\nI'm finding it harder to find a dataset of the motorway service station locations! I've manually downloaded files from https://www.motorwayservices.info/list/name and will extract info from them\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
