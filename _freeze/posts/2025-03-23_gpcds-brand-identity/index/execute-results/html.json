I'm reviving the project to give it a proper go in 2025 and want to get the branding *right* because it embodies the goals of the project. I originally experimented in Canva with the brandng design, here are some elements from that original document.\n\n![](gpcds-original-sketches.png)\n\nCore to the brand are the data visualisation categories:\n\n- Graphs are about connections. There are elements within them that have connections to other elements, in a limited sense these might be nodes and edges. Remember, in graphs quantitative measures aren’t a pre-requisite.\n\n- Plots are graphical representations where all communication channels are quantitatively measurable and values within a single quantitative scale could be quantitatively compared by the naked eye and without user interaction (eg tooltip or sonification). \n\n- Charts are graphical representations that include additional graphical (or other) elements to communicate variables otherwise encoded and/or have scales that cannot be quantitatively compared by the naked eye or without user interaction.\n\n- Data stories. Ahhh. We’d say stories are indefinable. This isn’t business intelligence - it’s storytelling and stories don’t mean the same thing to everyone.\n\n# Brand colours\n\nI designed a palette for these four categories with a fifth \"other\" category that's designed to work harmoniously with any of the other four. The primary colours of each category were chosen through the excellent interactive tool <https://coolors.co/generate> and then the other colours were generated through experimenting with [https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel](color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel). While iterating on the palette I continuously simulated the colours under the most common form of colour blindness. The chart below shows these 25 colours:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThere are 6 additional colours, primarily designed for web elements but could also be used alongside the visualisation category palettes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Category Idents\n\nEach visualisation category has an \"ident\" designed to incorporate the following elements:\n\n- Filled square: Each ident is a 1:1 rectangle filled in the primary colour for the category.\n\n- Four Disks: Each ident contains four disks of the same size, with an equal number filled with the secondary and tertiary colour from each category.\n\n- Lines: Each ident contains one or more lines using the tertiary darkest colour from each category\n\n- Text: Each ident contains its own name\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Plot\n\nThe major plot ident is intended to invoke a scatter plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n![](gg_plot_ident_major.png)\n\nThe minor ident is a simplified scatter plot \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Chart\n\nThe major chart ident is designed to invoke a bubble chart, but could also be interpeted as something more complex.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThe minor ident is designed to appear as a bubble chart.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Data Story\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nMinor ident\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Graph\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThe minor ident\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
